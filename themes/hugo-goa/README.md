## Demo

You can find the demo site in action [here](https://shenoydotme.github.io/hugo-goa-demo) and the source [here](https://github.com/shenoydotme/hugo-goa-demo).

## Installation

```
hugo new site quickstart
cd quickstart
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/shenoydotme/hugo-goa.git themes/hugo-goa
echo "theme = 'hugo-goa'" >> hugo.toml
hugo server
```

## Content creation

### Creating a Post

To create a new page or post in Hugo, follow these steps:

#### Create a New Post

Use the following Hugo command to create a new post. This will create a Markdown file for your post in the specified directory.

```bash
hugo new content posts/my-first-post.md
```

#### Edit the Post

After creating the post, you can go ahead and edit the newly created file. You'll find it under the `content/posts` directory in your Hugo site's content folder.

#### Preview Your Edits

To preview your edits in real-time, you can run the Hugo server with draft posts included. You can use either of these commands:

```bash
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

or

```bash
hugo server -D
```

#### Publishing Your Post

Once you have finished editing and are ready to publish your post, set `draft = false` in the article's front matter. This step is crucial to ensure that Hugo includes your post in the generated site.

Remember, until you set `draft = false`, Hugo will treat the post as a draft, and it won't appear in your published site unless you use the `-D` or `--buildDrafts` flags with `hugo server`.

### Organizing pages

To create standalone pages in Hugo, such as an "About" page or a "Projects" page, you can indeed override the default list behavior by adding an index.md file in the corresponding content directory. This approach allows for more control over the content and presentation of these specific pages, setting them apart from regular blog posts or list pages.

#### Create the Directory and index.md File:

To create a new standalone page, like a "Projects" page, you need to first create an index.md file in the appropriate directory. Use the Hugo command to do this:

```bash
hugo new projects/index.md
```

This command will create a new directory named projects inside the content folder of your Hugo site and then create an index.md file inside this projects directory.

#### Edit the index.md File:

Open the newly created index.md file in your text editor. This file will act as the main content file for your standalone page. Here, you can add the content for your "Projects" page.

#### Customize the Front Matter:

At the top of the index.md file, you will find the front matter, which is used by Hugo to store metadata about the page. You can customize this front matter as needed for your page.

#### Apply Custom Layouts (Optional):

If you want to apply a custom layout to this page, you can create a new layout file in the layouts directory of your Hugo site. For example, you might create a layout specifically for the projects page. Then, reference this custom layout in the front matter of your index.md file.

#### Build Your Site:

After setting up your index.md file and any custom layouts, run the Hugo command to build your site:

```
hugo --cleanDestinationDir
```

This will generate the static files for your site, including your new standalone page, in the public directory.

Remember, the index.md file in a directory allows you to create a standalone page with its own content and layout, different from the auto-generated list pages for blog posts or other content types. This method provides flexibility in organizing and presenting different types of content on your Hugo site.

### Publish the site

To publish your site using Hugo without deploying it, you need to run a specific command that tells Hugo to generate the static site in the public directory. This command will create all the necessary files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. To ensure that draft, future, or expired content is not included, you will use a particular flag with the command.

Here is the command you need to run in your terminal or command prompt where your Hugo site project is located:

```bash
hugo --cleanDestinationDir
```

This command does the following:

- **hugo**: This is the basic command to build your site.
- **--cleanDestinationDir**: This flag cleans out the public directory before building. It ensures that only current content is published, and no old or unwanted files are left in the directory.

Remember, this process only generates the static files in the public directory of your Hugo project. It does not deploy these files to a web server or hosting service. For deployment, you would need to follow additional steps depending on your hosting solution.

### Page settings

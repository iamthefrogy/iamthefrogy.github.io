### Overview

In this blog post, I am sharing a detailed **JWT Security Testing Checklist** document I have created and found immensely valuable for penetration testers, developers, and security teams. This checklist provides a structured approach to identifying vulnerabilities in JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) implementations.

### Why Share This Document?

JWTs are widely used for authentication and authorization, but they can introduce serious vulnerabilities if not implemented securely. By sharing this checklist, I hope to provide **practical guidance** to developers and penetration testers, bug-hunters.

### Whatâ€™s in the Checklist?

The checklist covers **27 common vulnerabilities** and their testing steps, expected outcomes, and security recommendations.

## Understanding VIP Monitoring in Threat Intelligence

### What is VIP Monitoring?

VIP Monitoring involves closely observing the digital assets and personal information of key individuals within an organization. The goal is to identify and mitigate potential threats proactively, such as phishing schemes targeting executives or security risks from exposed personal addresses.

### Why VIP Monitoring is Needed

- **High-Value Targets**: VIPs have direct access to sensitive systems, trade secrets, and strategic plans. Compromising their access poses significant risks to the organization's infrastructure.

- **Brand & Reputational Risk**: Attacks on public figures can lead to PR crises. Data breaches exposing personal information can erode trust in company leadership and the brand.

- **Financial Impact**: Threat actors may engage in market manipulation, fund theft, or extortion involving VIPs, leading to substantial financial losses for individuals and the organization.

- **Personal Safety**: Beyond digital threats, exposure of personal details like routines or addresses can lead to physical dangers, including stalking or kidnapping.

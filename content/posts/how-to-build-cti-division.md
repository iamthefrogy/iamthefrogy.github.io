+++

Establishing a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) division involves a structured approach encompassing planning, designing, and optimizing processes to effectively counter cyber threats. Below is a practical guide to building a CTI division:

## Phase 1: Plan for a CTI Program

1. **Understand the Basics of Threat Intelligence**:
   - **What**: Learn foundational concepts, importance, and goals of CTI for your company.
   - **Result**: Clear understanding of CTI's purpose within your organization.
   - *Action*: Leverage free resources, white papers, beginner guides, and industry certifications to build a solid grasp of CTI fundamentals.

2. **Assess Your Organization’s Current Threat Landscape**:
   - **What**: Evaluate existing threats related to brand protection, reputation, critical assets, vulnerabilities, attack surface, external presence, VIPs, etc.
   - **Result**: Comprehensive view of existing gaps in threat visibility.
   - *Action*: Use threat assessments and gap analysis frameworks to identify vulnerabilities.

3. **Map Out Your Organization’s Ideal Target State**:
   - **What**: Define short and long-term vision and objectives for your CTI program.
   - **Result**: Well-defined CTI program goals with clear metrics, objectives, and KPIs.
   - *Action*: Align objectives with business needs and cybersecurity strategy, engaging with the executive committee for support.

4. **Establish a Case to Management for CTI Program Buy-In**:
   - **What**: Present a business case to secure leadership buy-in and necessary resources.
   - **Result**: Management support and resource allocation.
   - *Action*: Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to highlight the value of CTI.

5. **Address Organizational Gaps with a Skilled CTI Team**:
   - **What**: Identify and fill roles required for effective CTI implementation.
   - **Result**: Functional CTI team in place.
   - *Action*: Recruit skilled personnel or invest in staff training programs.

6. **Strategically Outline Your CTI Process**:
   - **What**: Create a roadmap covering collection, analysis, and dissemination of threat intelligence.
   - **Result**: Structured and actionable CTI workflow.
   - *Action*: Include measurable milestones and adapt the process as threats evolve.

## Phase 2: Design an Intelligence Collection Strategy

1. **Design a Collection Strategy for Threat Intelligence**:
   - **What**: Identify intelligence requirements and sources to collect actionable information.
   - **Result**: Customized intelligence collection plan.
   - *Action*: Utilize diverse sources like OSINT, threat feeds, and dark web monitoring, including both commercial and open-source options.

2. **Normalize Intelligence Using Standard Frameworks**:
   - **What**: Adopt consistent formats, taxonomies, and protocols to ensure data interoperability.
   - **Result**: Streamlined and consistent data structure.
   - *Action*: Implement industry standards such as STIX and TAXII.

3. **Assess Different Collection Solutions**:
   - **What**: Evaluate tools and technologies to determine the best fit for your organizational needs.
   - **Result**: Optimal collection tools selected.
   - *Action*: Test tools for scalability, integration, and effectiveness.

4. **Validate That Collection Methods Produce Actionable Data**:
   - **What**: Continuously monitor and assess the quality and relevance of collected data.
   - **Result**: Actionable intelligence aligned with security goals.
   - *Action*: Regularly review data and refine collection processes.

## Phase 3: Optimize the Analysis Process

1. **Define Roles in the Threat Analysis Workflow**:
   - **What**: Assign clear responsibilities for analyzing, correlating, and prioritizing intelligence data.
   - **Result**: Clarity in the analysis process and accountability.
   - *Action*: Train analysts to detect and mitigate false positives.

2. **Enhance the Analysis Process for Efficiency**:
   - **What**: Implement tools and techniques to reduce manual effort and streamline threat evaluation.
   - **Result**: Faster, more efficient intelligence analysis.
   - *Action*: Utilize automation and machine learning for data correlation.

3. **Take Action on the Intelligence Findings**:
   - **What**: Convert intelligence insights into specific, actionable responses or mitigations.
   - **Result**: Improved incident response and SIEM threat hunting capabilities.
   - *Action*: Develop playbooks for various threat scenarios to enable detection monitoring.

4. **Create High-Priority Intelligence Runbooks**:
   - **What**: Develop step-by-step guides for addressing the most critical threat scenarios.
   - **Result**: Standardized responses to critical threats.
   - *Action*: Regularly update runbooks based on emerging threats.

5. **Build a Centralized Threat Knowledge Portal**:
   - **What**: Consolidate intelligence insights, reports, and lessons learned into a single repository.
   - **Result**: Enhanced knowledge sharing and historical reference.
   - *Action*: Implement a platform accessible to relevant stakeholders for continuous learning and improvement.

By following these phases and activities, organizations can establish a robust CTI division that proactively identifies and mitigates cyber threats, aligning security efforts with business objectives.

Yes, even with the stunning views, free gourmet meals, and bean bags galore, something will always be missing.**

**That’s why it’s crucial to prioritize. Choose at least 2–3 factors that matter the most to you, and if those are fulfilled, consider that company a good match. Remember, perfection is a myth—even in Silicon Valley.**

| **Criteria**                       | **What to Consider**                                                                                                                              | **Example**                                                                                                          |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Select a mentor who is **down to earth**, willing to learn and coach.                                     | Don’t select mentors solely based on their **number of certifications**.   |
| Look for mentors who provide a **clear vision and guidance** for your career goals over 2–5 years.        | Don’t base your decision only on their **online presence or popularity**.  |
| Choose mentors who **contribute to the community** regularly.                                             | Avoid choosing mentors just for their **technical hacking skills**.        |

| Give time to **research and regularly communicate** with potential mentors.                               | Don’t rush the decision without proper evaluation.                         |
| Select more than one mentor with **diverse mentorship styles** to maximize benefits.                      | Don’t expect one mentor to meet all your learning needs.                   |
| Look for mentors who can **connect you to other professionals and resources**.                            | Don’t skip evaluating how well their mentorship style aligns with you.     |
| Choose mentors who inspire and motivate with their **passion for the field**.                             | Don’t settle for mentors who don’t show enthusiasm or willingness to guide.|
| Find mentors who are patient, understanding, and provide **constructive feedback** for growth.            | Avoid mentors who overwhelm or discourage you.                             |

|                                                   | - It’s beneficial to obtain certificates in both technical and managerial areas of your cybersecurity domain.                                                                   |

|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Typos and Grammatical Errors**       | It's crucial to proofread your resume before submitting it. Errors may suggest a lack of attention to detail or professionalism. |
| **Providing Inaccurate Information**   | Whether it's wrong dates or exaggerated qualifications, falsifying information is always a big no-no. |
| **Using an Unprofessional Email Address** | Your email address should be simple, professional, and easily identifiable. Avoid inappropriate or quirky handles. |
| **Including Personal Information**     | Details like age, religion, marital status, etc., could lead to unconscious bias or legal issues.     |
| **Having an Objective That's Not Related to the Job** | If you include an objective, it should directly relate to the position you're applying for.           |
| **One-size-fits-all Resumes**          | Tailor your resume to the job. Highlight relevant experiences and skills.                            |
| **Overloading Your Resume**            | Keep it concise (1-2 pages). Too much text can overwhelm and hide key points.                        |
| **Listing Responsibilities Instead of Achievements** | Employers care more about your accomplishments than job duties. Highlight results and impacts.       |
| **Including Irrelevant Information**   | Avoid hobbies or experiences that don't relate to the job. Focus on relevant qualifications.          |
| **Not Using Action Verbs**             | Use strong action verbs to begin bullet points (e.g., "Designed," "Implemented," "Led").             |
| **Using Clichéd Buzzwords**            | Words like "synergy" or "team player" are overused. Be specific about skills and accomplishments.     |
| **Lack of Specifics**                  | Vague statements don't help. Quantify your accomplishments (e.g., "Increased efficiency by 25%").    |
| **Poor Formatting**                    | Stick to a clean, professional layout with standard fonts. Avoid unusual styles or colors.            |
| **Including References on Your Resume** | Unless asked, don't include references. "References available upon request" is unnecessary.          |
| **Outdated Information**               | Remove irrelevant or old details unless highly relevant.                                             |
| **Not Using Numbers**                  | Quantify achievements to give a clearer picture of your impact (e.g., "Managed $1M budget").         |
| **Using an Inappropriate Resume File Name** | Ensure the file name is professional and clear (e.g., "John_Doe_Resume.pdf").                        |
| **Having an Unfocused Career Objective or Summary** | Clearly communicate your career goals and why you're a fit for the position.                         |
| **Excessive Jargon or Acronyms**       | Avoid too much technical jargon unless it's industry standard. Explain acronyms if needed.            |
| **Inconsistent Tense**                 | Use past tense for previous jobs and present tense for your current job.                             |
| **Long Paragraphs**                    | Use bullet points to make information easier to read and digest.                                     |
| **No Clear Structure**                 | Organize your resume with headers, consistent formatting, and bullet points.                         |
| **Using "I" or "My"**                  | Avoid personal pronouns. Focus on action statements and achievements.                                |
| **Not Highlighting Promotions**        | Highlight promotions to showcase career progression and achievements.                                |
| **Not Aligning Resume and LinkedIn Profile** | Ensure consistency between your resume and LinkedIn. Present a unified career narrative.             |
| **Lack of Contact Information**        | Include professional email and phone number. Ensure your LinkedIn profile is linked.                 |
| **Including a Picture**                | Unless required, avoid including a photo. It could lead to bias and isn't necessary.                 |
| **Not Including a Cover Letter**       | A well-crafted cover letter provides context and personality, enhancing your application.             |
| **Not Showcasing Transferable Skills** | Highlight skills applicable to the new role, especially when switching industries or positions.       |
| **Irrelevant Job Experience**          | Focus on experience relevant to the job. Leave out unrelated positions unless they showcase skills.   |
| **Missing Keywords**                   | Include keywords from the job description for ATS optimization.                                      |
| **Overusing Bold or Italic Text**      | Use emphasis sparingly to avoid clutter and maintain professionalism.                                |
| **No Hyperlinks to Professional Online Profiles** | Include links to LinkedIn, portfolios, or other professional online profiles.                        |
| **Including High School Information**  | Leave out high school details unless you're a recent graduate. Focus on higher education or experience. |

## 18. Why is finding a job abroad so challenging for international candidates?
<left><img src="/images/myth.png" alt="myth" width="55"/></left>
Why companies don't sponsor, they just need to provide a sponsorship letter right then why they don't do it?

Do you know how much it would cost a company if they sponsor a candidate outside of their own country? (**I am taking an example of UK as I have UK experience**)

**If candidate is married then they ask companies to sponsor for both him/herself and partner which would double this cost.**

Imagine if you are running your own firm in UK, and if you are flooded with plenty of resumes locally from UK, would you rather spend above amount to hire someone outside of UK? No right, hence these is the main reason along with some other factors like time duration, paper work, etc. due to which companies hesitate to sponsor.

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visa Issues**               | Companies may hesitate to sponsor work visas due to high costs, paperwork, and risks. Some governments impose strict immigration rules, making it harder for employers.    |
| **Local Experience**          | Employers often prefer candidates with local experience to ensure familiarity with industry practices, regulatory requirements, and cultural norms.                        |
| **Cultural Differences**      | Language barriers, communication styles, and understanding of workplace customs can impact a candidate's ability to fit into the work environment.                         |
| **Networking**                | Lack of local professional networks makes it harder for international candidates to learn about job opportunities and establish connections.                               |
| **Unique Skill Requirements** | Some positions require niche expertise, and companies may opt to hire locally to avoid sponsorship complications.                                                         |

| **Certificate of Sponsorship** | Employers issue this document to the candidate as part of their visa application process.                                                                                  |
| **Resident Labour Market Test** | (Replaced by a points-based system) Employers must show that the job is suitable for international candidates and meets skill and salary requirements.                      |
| **Ongoing Sponsorship Duties** | Companies must monitor and report compliance with visa conditions. Any failure can lead to penalties or loss of their Sponsor License.                                     |

### Final Tips

- **Patience Is Key**: Job hunting abroad is a long-term effort, and there’s no guaranteed timeline for success.
- **Manage Expectations**: Treat the process like daily chores—keep working consistently without high expectations to avoid disappointment.
- **Focus on Building Skills and Connections**: Even if a foreign job isn’t immediate, the process enhances your professional profile and prepares you for future opportunities.

## 19. What’s the best approach to kickstart foreign job hunting?
By following the below bulletproof framework with dedication, you are setting yourself up for success in breaking into cybersecurity or landing a foreign job.

### Step 1: Read the Guide
- Carefully read the entire guide word by word to understand the comprehensive process and strategies. There is not only 1 or few sections which would land you a job. A combination of multiple sections from this guide only will help you in your job hunt.

### Step 2: Domain Identification
1. Choose 2-3 cybersecurity domains you are interested in exploring further.
2. Revisit the guide and focus on gathering 10 key answers for each domain.
3. Narrow down your interests to 1-2 domains that align with your goals.

### Step 3: Plan Your Learning Path
- Select a learning path based on your personal, professional, and social commitments.
- Find relevant resources (online platforms, certifications, mentors) to enhance your skills.
- If unsure about resources, connect with a mentor or expert for guidance.

### Step 4: Continuous Learning Sharing to Create Outreach on LinkedIn
- Dedicate daily or weekly time to learning.
  - **Action Items:**
    - Share your learning experiences and takeaways on LinkedIn for visibility and networking.
    - Update your resume and LinkedIn profile with new skills and expertise every 2 weeks.

### Step 5: Create Minimum 10 Target Countries
1. <left><img src="/images/tip.png" alt="tip" width="55"/></left> Select top 10 countries in which you are interested to migrate. Imagine depending upon geopolitical stuff, market demand, government rules and many other factors your dream country may or may not be ease. Hence you need to pick a region rather than specific country. Region breakdown is as follows:

| **Region**   | **Description**                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **EMEA**     | Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Covers countries in these continents.       |
| **APAC**     | Asia-Pacific. Includes Asia and Oceania (e.g., China, India, Australia).     |
| **AMER**     | Americas. Covers North, Central, and South America.                          |
| **LATAM**    | Latin America. Focuses on Central and South America, including the Caribbean.|
| **ANZ**      | Australia and New Zealand. Often part of APAC but sometimes distinct.        |
| **MENA**     | Middle East and North Africa. Subset of EMEA.                                |
| **CIS**      | Commonwealth of Independent States. Includes Russia and neighboring countries.|


### Step 6: Expand Your Network
1. <left><img src="/images/tip.png" alt="tip" width="55"/></left>**Connect with Professionals**
   - Add 30/40 security professionals (at least at your same designation or above, I prefer anyone who is manager and above) daily from your target countries of any region you chose from above.
   - Rotate to a new country every week.

2. <left><img src="/images/tip.png" alt="tip" width="55"/></left>**Connect with Recruiters**  
   - Add 20 security recruiters daily from the same target countries.
   - Engage in meaningful conversations and discussions.
   - Below are the various roles for specific Cybersecurity Recruiters you can find on LinkedIn.
      - Cybersecurity Recruiter
      - Information Security Recruiter
      - Cybersecurity Talent Acquisition
      - Cybersecurity Headhunte
      - Security Recruitment Specialist
      - Cybersecurity Staffing
      - Cyber Talent Consultant
   - <left><img src="/images/tip.png" alt="tip" width="55"/></left>Do you know you can create boolean search queries based on your need and perform search effectively on LinkedIn.     

      ##### Basic Search
      ("Cybersecurity Recruiter" OR "Information Security Recruiter" OR "Cyber Talent Acquisition Specialist" OR "Security Recruitment Specialist")

      ##### Targeting Specific Roles
      (("Cybersecurity Recruiter" OR "Information Security Recruiter") AND ("SOC Analyst" OR "Penetration Testing" OR "Cloud Security"))

      ##### Narrow by Location
      (("Cybersecurity Recruiter" OR "Cyber Talent Consultant") AND ("USA" OR "UK" OR "India"))

      ##### Targeting Agencies
      (("Cybersecurity Recruiter" OR "Cybersecurity Staffing Specialist") AND ("CyberSN" OR "Hays Technology" OR "Optiv"))
    - <left><img src="/images/tip.png" alt="tip" width="55"/></left>Alternatively you can also use advance filters of LinkedIn to narrow down your searches as mentioned in the below screenshot.

### Step 7: Optimize Your Resume
1. Tailor your resume to match the job description:
   - Identify important keywords from the job posting.
   - Include these keywords strategically in your resume and LinkedIn profile.

2. Ensure your LinkedIn profile and resume reflect consistent and professional messaging.

### Step 8: Apply Strategically
1. Apply to 10 jobs daily in each target country.
   - If focusing on your home country, follow the same routine.
2. <left><img src="/images/tip.png" alt="tip" width="55"/></left> Track your applications using a spreadsheet. It is extremely important to ask the full name of the recruiter and his/her numbers. Lots of companies when they do the first initial screening HR call, you would not have an official email. Post screening if they don't come back and you want to reachout, you won't have any contact information. Sometimes more than 1 agencies or recruiters are hiring for the same position in one large company. So it's easy for you to map all these information in your excel tracker.

### Timeline and Expectations
- **Duration**: Follow this methodology consistently for **8 months** to see tangible results.  
- <left><img src="/images/warning.png" alt="warning" width="55"/></left>
**Results**: While there’s no guaranteed timeline, consistent efforts will lead to:
  - A cybersecurity job within a year.
  - Expanded LinkedIn network and increased visibility.
  - Valuable skills and knowledge.

### Additional Benefits (Even Without Securing a Foreign Job)
- **Expanded Network**: Connect with professionals from diverse backgrounds and geographies.  
- **Regular Learning**: Stay updated with the latest industry trends and insights.  
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Gain recognition through LinkedIn activity and expertise sharing.  
- **Future Opportunities**: Build relationships with connections who may help with referrals or recommendations.

### Notes for Success
- **Consistency is Key**: Treat these steps as daily habits without expecting instant results.  
- **Mindset**: Approach the process with patience and persistence, knowing that rejections are part of the journey.  
- **Networking Impact**: Your connections and shared content can lead to unexpected opportunities over time.

| - Use hashtags to filter specific content (latest 24 hours/week).      | - Don't waste time on overly broad hashtags or outdated trends.                                  |
| - Create a schedule for regular updates and research.                  | - Don't consume random content without verifying its credibility.                               |
| - Take notes and create summaries for key learnings.                   | - Don't blindly share or rely on unverified information from social media.                      |
| - Engage with communities for discussions and shared insights.         | - Don't ignore critical feedback or constructive suggestions in community discussions.           |
| - Bookmark useful resources and categorize them for easy reference.    | - Don't overload yourself with excessive resources; focus on quality over quantity.             |

## 25. How do I stay motivated and overcome setbacks?

<center><img src="/images/skill-demotivate.png" alt="gpt1" width="450"/></center>


Demotivation in cybersecurity is not new. With the high level of competition in the industry, common causes include:

- Observing others' success while feeling stuck.
- Facing disrespect or indifference from peers or employers.
- Struggling to find a clear path to success.
- Falling prey to the allure of fame and monetary rewards on social media.
- Any other personal challenges or setbacks.

### What You Need to Realize
The key to staying motivated in cybersecurity lies in shifting your perspective about learning and growth. Here's the approach to take:

1. **Accept the Knowledge Gap**  
   Others may seem to know more than you, but remember, it's all about expanding your own knowledge. Identify what they know that you don’t.

2. **Leverage Resources**  
   - Learn from YouTube, blogs, and free materials.
   - Find mentors who can guide you in the right direction.
   - Focus on understanding what skills you lack and work on them.

3. **Celebrate Learning Progress**  
   Every time you gain new skills or knowledge, you're narrowing the gap between what you know and what they know. This should motivate you to keep going.

4. **Adopt a Growth Mindset**  
   Instead of seeing others’ success as discouraging, view it as inspiration. If someone knows five things you don’t, use that as an opportunity to learn and grow.

5. **Be Grateful for Guidance**  
   Appreciate the people or resources that help you learn. Without them, you might not have realized what you needed to grow.

6. **Document and Reflect**  
   Keep a note of what you’ve learned. Revisit this regularly to track your progress and stay motivated.


### Overcoming Demotivation Due to Experience Gap

   It's common to feel intimidated or demotivated when comparing your experience to those who have been in cybersecurity for decades. However, here's a fresh perspective to help you stay motivated:

   <center><img src="/images/exp-demotivate.png" alt="gpt1" width="850"/></center>

### The Reality of Experience
   1. **Experience vs. Life Expectancy**  
      While others may have more experience today (orange bar), you still have time (pink bar) to build your own expertise. Everyone starts somewhere.

   2. **Time Is on Your Side**  
      Over time, experienced professionals will retire or step away from the field. By then, you'll be in a position to fill their shoes with your accumulated experience.

   3. **A Future Edge**  
      Younger professionals (pink bar) often have the advantage of learning and adapting to newer technologies. This positions you for a more dynamic career in the future.

## The Final Perspective
By constantly learning and growing, you can bridge the knowledge gap. If someone knows more today, it’s an opportunity for you to catch up tomorrow. With dedication and focus, you’ll be able to stand on equal ground in terms of skills and expertise.

At the end of the day, we all have the same life expectancy to grow and learn. The journey is about making the most of the time you have, staying adaptable, and advancing with the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

Embrace your potential, keep learning, stay positive, and remember that your career is a marathon, not a sprint.

## üê∏ What's the Story Behind the Name 'Frogy'?

During an epic gaming session in the hot, muggy Indian nights of my engineering days, I pulled off some of the most amazing jump shots my teammates had ever seen in **Counter-Strike**. Against all odds, I landed these leaps perfectly, and my teammates started calling me "Frog" for my jumping skills.

The name stuck, but it also held a playful connection to a family joke my mom used to make about me "jumping from one thing to another," especially during study sessions. Over time, 'Frogy' became a badge of honor, symbolizing my dynamic energy, both in gaming and later in **cybersecurity**.
